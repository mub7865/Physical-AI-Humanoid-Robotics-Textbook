## Prompt
```
Draft the `03-python-code.md` chapter for Module 1. Explain `rclpy` with practical Python code examples, including a 'Hello World' publisher example. Ensure 1000+ words, simple English, and use real-world analogies for technical terms as per the hybrid approach, introducing terms boldly and immediately following with a simple analogy. Focus on the content writer persona. The content should be saved to `book/docs/01-module-1-ros2/03-python-code.md`.

## Response
Created the `/mnt/d/AI-DRIVEN_AND_SPEC-DRIVEN_HACKATHON/book/docs/01-module-1-ros2/03-python-code.md` chapter, explaining `rclpy` with a 'Hello World' publisher example, adhering to content and formatting standards. The chapter introduces `rclpy` and core ROS 2 concepts like nodes, topics, messages, publishers, and subscribers using analogies. It includes a conceptual Python code example for a publisher and provides detailed explanations of each part. The content is over 1000 words, uses simple English, and maintains a professional, educational tone.
