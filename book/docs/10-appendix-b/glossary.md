# Glossary of Robotic Terms 📖

A quick reference for the technical jargon used in Physical AI.

### A
* **Actuator:** A motor or mechanism that moves a robot joint.
* **Agent:** An AI program that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve a goal.

### D
* **Degree of Freedom (DoF):** The number of independent ways a robot can move (e.g., a human arm has 7 DoF).
* **Digital Twin:** A virtual replica of a physical robot used for simulation and training.
* **Dynamics:** The study of forces and torques that cause motion.

### E
* **Edge Computing:** Processing AI on the robot itself (e.g., Jetson Orin) rather than in the cloud.
* **Embodied Intelligence:** AI that interacts with the physical world through a body (sensors/actuators).
* **End Effector:** The device at the end of a robotic arm (e.g., a gripper, hand, or welder).

### G
* **Gazebo:** An open-source 3D robotics simulator focused on accurate physics.
* **Generative AI:** AI models (like GPT-4) that can create new content, including code and plans for robots.

### I
* **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** A sensor that measures acceleration and rotation (like an inner ear).
* **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Calculating joint angles needed to reach a specific point in space.
* **Isaac Sim:** NVIDIA's photorealistic robotics simulator based on Omniverse.

### L
* **LiDAR:** Light Detection and Ranging. Uses lasers to create a 3D map of the environment.
* **LLM (Large Language Model):** AI trained on massive text data (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3).

### N
* **Nav2:** The Navigation Stack 2. A standard library for moving robots from A to B safely.
* **Node:** A single executable process in ROS 2.

### P
* **Physical AI:** AI systems that function in physical reality and comprehend physical laws.

### R
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Enhancing an AI's knowledge by retrieving data from a database (like this textbook).
* **rclpy:** ROS Client Library for Python.
* **ROS 2:** Robot Operating System 2. The middleware standard for robotics.

### S
* **Sim-to-Real:** The process of training a robot in simulation and deploying it to the real world.
* **SLAM:** Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. Building a map while tracking your location in it.

### T
* **Topic:** A channel for streaming data between ROS 2 nodes.

### U
* **URDF:** Unified Robot Description Format. An XML file describing a robot's physical structure.

### V
* **VLA (Vision-Language-Action):** Models that combine vision and text to generate robotic actions.
* **VSLAM:** Visual SLAM. Using cameras instead of LiDAR for mapping.

### Z
* **Zero-Shot Learning:** The ability of an AI to perform a task it has never seen before.
