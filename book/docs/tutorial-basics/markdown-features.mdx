# Safety Protocols: Working with Physical Robots 🛡️

## The First Law of Robotics: Do No Harm

Unlike pure software, Physical AI has consequences. If you write a bad loop in Python, your computer freezes. If you write a bad loop in Robotics, your robot might drive off a table, overheat a motor, or injure someone.

This guide outlines the critical safety protocols you MUST follow when working with the hardware described in Chapter 8.

## 1. The Emergency Stop (E-Stop) 🛑

Every robot must have a "Kill Switch." This is a mechanism to cut power immediately if the robot behaves unpredictably.

:::danger[CRITICAL SAFETY RULE]
**NEVER** operate a mobile robot without a verified Software or Hardware E-Stop.
:::

### How to implement an E-Stop:
* **Software:** Map a specific key (e.g., `Spacebar` or `Enter`) on your teleop keyboard to immediately publish `0` velocity to `/cmd_vel`.
* **Hardware:** On larger robots like the Unitree Go2, always keep the remote controller in your hand with your finger on the "Lock/Stop" button.

## 2. Battery Safety (LiPo Handling) 🔋

Robots typically run on **Lithium Polymer (LiPo)** batteries. These are energy-dense but volatile.

:::warning[Fire Hazard]
LiPo batteries can catch fire if punctured, overcharged, or short-circuited. **Never leave charging batteries unattended.**
:::

**Best Practices:**
1.  **Storage:** Store batteries in a fireproof LiPo bag.
2.  **Voltage:** Never discharge a cell below 3.2V. It will permanently damage the battery.
3.  **Swelling:** If a battery looks "puffy" or swollen, **DISCARD IT IMMEDIATELY** at a recycling center. Do not use it.

## 3. Mechanical Pinch Points 🤏

Humanoid robots have powerful joints (knees, elbows) that close with significant force.

:::caution[Watch Your Fingers]
Keep hands and cables clear of joints while the robot is powered on. A servo motor does not "feel" pain; it will close on your finger if commanded to.
:::

* **The Rule of Thumb:** If the robot is powered, assume it can move at any time. AI agents are probabilistic; they might decide to move an arm unexpectedly.

## 4. Software Guardrails 💻

Before letting an LLM (like GPT-4) control a robot, you must implement a "Pre-Flight Check" in your code.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bad" label="❌ Unsafe Code" default>
    ```python
    # Dangerous! The LLM sends raw commands directly to motors.
    command = llm.generate("Move forward")
    robot.execute(command)
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="good" label="✅ Safe Code">
    ```python
    # Safe! We validate the command first.
    command = llm.generate("Move forward")
    
    if safety_check(command) == True:
        robot.execute(command)
    else:
        print("Safety Violation: Command blocked.")
        robot.stop()
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 5. Sim-to-Real Checklist ✅

Before you deploy code from Isaac Sim to the real Jetson Orin, go through this checklist:

* [ ] **Simulation Test:** Did the robot survive 10/10 runs in Gazebo without crashing?
* [ ] **Speed Limits:** Have you capped the maximum velocity (e.g., `0.5 m/s`) in your config?
* [ ] **Space:** Is the physical testing area clear of obstacles and pets?
* [ ] **Cables:** Are all wires secured so they don't get caught in wheels/legs?

### Final Thought
**"Move fast and break things"** is a bad motto for robotics.
**"Move deliberately and verify everything"** keeps your hardware (and fingers) intact.
