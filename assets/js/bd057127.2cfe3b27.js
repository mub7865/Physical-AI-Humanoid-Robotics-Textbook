This objective requires more than a simple memorization of terms; it demands a conceptual grasp of what makes an AI "physical" and what characteristics distinguish a "humanoid robot" from other forms of robotics. Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the real world through physical embodiment, sensors, and actuators. It encompasses disciplines where AI algorithms directly control physical entities, enabling them to perceive, reason, and act within dynamic environments. Humanoid robotics, a significant subset of physical AI, focuses on creating robots that mimic the human form and capabilities. Understanding these core definitions is paramount as they establish the fundamental vocabulary and conceptual framework for all discussions that follow, allowing you to accurately categorize and analyze different robotic systems and AI applications in physical space.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.h2,{id:"2-tracing-the-historical-development-of-robotics-and-ai",children:"2.
